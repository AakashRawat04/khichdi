if i were to write a description regarding why i made this? i would end up writing a 10 page note about my frustrated self. this is a work in progress. as the name suggests its messed up and chaotic just like [khichdi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khichdi_(dish)). bye.

1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your Redis server or khichdi... whater you like to call it.
